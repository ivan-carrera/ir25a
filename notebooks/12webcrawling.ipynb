      "Recipe Title: Rotisserie Chicken\n",
      "Description: Rotisserie chicken that's easy to cook on a gas grill and turns out moist and juicy with crispy skin. This is a simple recipe that our family loves.\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 (3 pound) whole chicken\n",
      "- 1 pinch salt\n",
      "- ¼ cup butter, melted\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon salt\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon ground paprika\n",
      "- ¼ tablespoon ground black pepper\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Intimidated by the idea of making a rotisserie chicken at home? We're here to help. Get your grill and rotisserie attachment ready — you'll want to try this recipe ASAP.\n",
      "2. Here's what you'll need to make rotisserie chicken at home:\n",
      "3. · Whole Chicken: This recipe is meant for a whole 3-pound chicken. If your chicken is larger or smaller, you'll have to adjust the cooking time.· Butter: Butter keeps the chicken moist and juicy, while giving the seasonings something to stick to.· Seasonings: The rotisserie chicken is simply seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika.\n",
      "4. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this rotisserie chicken:\n",
      "5. Season the chicken cavity with salt and place it on a rotisserie (tie the wings and legs if you have twine or string available). Set the grill on high and cook for 10 minutes. Turn the grill down to medium and baste with a mixture of the butter and the seasonings. Close the lid and continue cooking, basting occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through. The internal temperature should reach at least 180 degrees F.\n",
      "6. A cooked rotisserie chicken should stay good for about four days in a shallow, airtight container in the refrigerator.\n",
      "7. Allow the chicken to cool for about 15 minutes before carving. To carve:\n",
      "8. 1. Place the chicken, breast-side up, on a cutting board.2. Pull one of the legs away from the body and slice through the meat until the hip bone is exposed. Then, pull the leg harder until the leg is detached.3. Use your knife to separate the drumstick and thigh.4. Pull the wing tip away from the breast until you can easily cut through the joint.5. Slice one of the breasts away from the breastbone. Repeat with the other breast.\n",
      "9. If you go through the trouble of making a rotisserie chicken at home, you'll likely want to enjoy it on its own with a side salad or roasted vegetables.\n",
      "10. What about the leftovers? Don't let even a bite of that chicken go to waste. Explore some of these mouthwatering collections for delicious inspiration:\n",

      "12. Reheat rotisserie chicken in the microwave, in the oven, or even in the air fryer.\n",
      "13. · Microwave: Place the chicken on a plate, cover with a damp paper towel, and microwave until the chicken is heated through.· Oven: Place the chicken in a baking dish, pour in chicken broth (about ¼-inch deep), cover with aluminum foil, and bake at 400 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes or until heated through.· Air Fryer: Place the chicken in the basket of the air fryer and cook at 350 degrees F for three to four minutes, or until crispy and heated through.\n",
      "14. \"This is only our second time using our grill's rotisserie attachment for the grill,\" says CHRISTINESAVILLE. \"This recipe knocked the much more complex one out of the park! Delicious and easy to make! I wish I had a picture. It was perfect.\"\n",
      "15. \"This is the best rotisserie chicken I've made, and I'll add, also beats baked,\" raves Melissa M. \"Very juicy, done right, and great flavor. I put liquid smoke, pineapple juice and water in a pan underneath to add more moisture, and basted with butter and basil pesto every 30-45 min.\"\n",
      "16. \"We just got a new grill along with a rotisserie,\" says Dishy. \"Couldn't wait to try it out and this recipe was perfect. I even did two chickens (Doubled the recipe) at one time and they both turned out great. Very moist and flavorful!\"\n",

      "20. Place rotisserie over the preheated grill and cook for 10 minutes.\n",
      "21. Meanwhile, quickly mix together butter, 1 tablespoon of salt, paprika, and pepper. Turn the grill down to medium and baste chicken with butter mixture.\n",
