Actually,\\nI am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end\\nto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they\\nare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\\nfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final\\nregular season game.          PENS RULE!!!\\n\\n\n",

This frees the\\nSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to\\nstart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the\\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\\n\\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\\nthe data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other\\nprocesses wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.\\n\n",

A neurologist\\ncan also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the\\ndiagnosis.\\n\\nDN&gt; &gt;&gt;Also, since many people are convinced they have brain tumors or other\\nDN&gt; &gt;&gt;serious pathology, it may be cheaper to just get a CT scan then have\\nDN&gt; &gt;&gt;them come into the ER every few weeks.\\nDN&gt; And easier than taking the time to reassure the patient, right?\\nDN&gt; Personally, I don't think this can ever be justified.\\n\\nSigh.  It may never be justifiable, but I sometimes do it.  Even\\nafter I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic\\nexamination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis,\\nsalted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask \"why can't you\\norder a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?\"  Aunt Millie often gets\\ninto the conversation, as in \"they ignored Aunt Millie's headaches\\nfor years\", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or\\nwhatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a\\npatient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hear\\nwhat your magic is.\\n\\nEvery once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG.\\nMind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor,\\nbut the patient feels like \"something is being done\" (as if the\\nhours I spent talking with and examining the patient were\\n\"nothing\"), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper\\nthan CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.</td>\n",

Man, they\\nare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\\nfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway.

This frees the\\nSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to\\nstart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the\\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\\n\\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\\nthe data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other\\nprocesses wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.\\n   \n",

It may never be justifiable, but I sometimes do it.

If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a\\npatient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hear\\nwhat your magic is.\\n\\nEvery once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG.\\nMind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor,\\nbut the patient feels like \"something is being done\" (as if the\\nhours I spent talking with and examining the patient were\\n\"nothing\"), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper\\nthan CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.   \n",

I ended up\\npressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU\\ncooler back on.  So far so good.\\n\\nHave others had this problem?  How do you ensure that the weight of\\nthe CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its\\nsocket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case?\\n   \n",

BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me\\nnowhere.  After being routed to a \"Firebird Specialist\", I was able\\nto confirm that this is in fact the case.\\n\\nAt first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio.\\nShe wouldn't go into any details, so I don't know if there were some\\nshipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they\\nsimply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier.  As I say, she\\nwas pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this,\\nfeel free to respond.  Supposedly, this problem is now solved.\\n\\nSecond, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related\\nto the six-speed Manual transmission.  So as of this posting, there is\\na production hold on these cars.  She claimed part of the delay was\\nnot wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore\\nhaving to wait for the right high quality parts...  I'm not positive\\nthat this applies to the Camaro as well, but I'm guessing it would.\\n\\nCan anyone else shed some light on this?\\n\\nChris S.\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nChris Silvester      | \"Any man capable of getting himself elected President\\nchriss@sam.amgen.com |  should by no means be allowed to do the job\"\\nchriss@netcom.com    |   - Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy   \n",

Man, they\\nare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\\nfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway.

       "      <td>DN&gt; From: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye)\\nDN&gt; A neurology\\nDN&gt; consultation is cheaper than a scan.\\n\\nAnd also better, because a neurologist can make a differential\\ndiagnosis between migraine, tension-type headache, cluster, benign\\nintracranial hypertension, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and other\\nheadache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan.  A neurologist\\ncan also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the\\ndiagnosis.\\n\\nDN&gt; &gt;&gt;Also, since many people are convinced they have brain tumors or other\\nDN&gt; &gt;&gt;serious pathology, it may be cheaper to just get a CT scan then have\\nDN&gt; &gt;&gt;them come into the ER every few weeks.\\nDN&gt; And easier than taking the time to reassure the patient, right?\\nDN&gt; Personally, I don't think this can ever be justified.\\n\\nSigh.  It may never be justifiable, but I sometimes do it.  Even\\nafter I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic\\nexamination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis,\\nsalted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask \"why can't you\\norder a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?\"  Aunt Millie often gets\\ninto the conversation, as in \"they ignored Aunt Millie's headaches\\nfor years\", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or\\nwhatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a\\npatient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hear\\nwhat your magic is.\\n\\nEvery once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG.\\nMind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor,\\nbut the patient feels like \"something is being done\" (as if the\\nhours I spent talking with and examining the patient were\\n\"nothing\"), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper\\nthan CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.</td>\n",

As I say, she\\nwas pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this,\\nfeel free to respond.  Supposedly, this problem is now solved.\\n\\nSecond, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related\\nto the six-speed Manual transmission.  So as of this posting, there is\\na production hold on these cars.  She claimed part of the delay was\\nnot wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore\\nhaving to wait for the right high quality parts...
